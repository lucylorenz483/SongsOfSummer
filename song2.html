            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Clairo's new album, Charm, released in the summer of 2024, is already being hailed as one of the best albums of the season. Among the standout tracks, Juna shines brightly as a perfect summer anthem. It's an upbeat yet mellow song that effortlessly captures the essence of a sunny day, making it a delightful listen for any summer occasion. With its breezy melodies and Clairo's signature soothing vocals, Juna feels like the musical equivalent of sunshine, making it an easy choice for any summer playlist. </p>
