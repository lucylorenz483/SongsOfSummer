            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Clairo is new ablum called Charm came out in the summer 2024. One of the best ablums of the summer, but if I had to choose one of the songs to be on this list it has to be Juna. Juna is a upbeat but mellow song that just brings the sun out on any summer day. </p>
