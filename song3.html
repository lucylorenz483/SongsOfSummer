            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This has truly been a Chappell Roan summer, and if you haven't heard of her yet, it's time to get familiar. She became an overnight sensation for all the right reasons, capturing hearts with her unique style, vibrant energy, and catchy tunes. Her songs have a way of drawing you in, making you feel like you’re part of her world. If I could, I’d include every track she’s released on this list, but that wouldn’t be fair to the other amazing artists out there. I picked this particular song because, without fail, every time it comes on, I can't help but dance and imagine stepping into Chappell Roan's shoes. It's that infectious blend of fun and confidence that makes her music perfect for summer, bringing joy and energy to every moment. </p>
