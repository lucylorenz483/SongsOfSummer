            <p>This has been a Chappel Roan summer, and if you don't know who they are you need to get on the internet more. She became on over night sensation for a good reason. If I could I would put all her songs on this list, but I don't know how fair that would be for the other artist. I put this song becuase without fail everytime I put this song on I can't help but dance and step in Chappel Roans shoes.  </p>
