            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This British indie rock band became popular this summer. Releasing their album Prelude to Ecstasy earlier this year brought them instant recognition. With their theatrical and mystical stage presence, you will just fall in love with this band. The song I love and cherish the most is Nothing Matters. It is a rock and pop mixed song that has a hint of angst—one of those songs you scream with your girls, windows down, on a hot summer day. It's a song that gets your blood pumping throughout your whole body. I just had to add this song to the list.   </p>
