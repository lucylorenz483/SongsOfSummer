            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This british indie rock band that became popular this summer. Releasing their album Prelude to Ectacy earlier this year grew them into instant recongiation. With their thearaitcal and mystical stage presents you will just fall in love with this band. The song I love and charish the most is Nothing Matters. It is a Rock and Pop mixed song that has an hint of angst. On of the songs you scream with your girls to with your windows down in your car on a hot summer day. It is a song that gets your blood pumping thorugh out your whole body. I just had to add this song to this list.   </p>
