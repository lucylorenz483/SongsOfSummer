            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p> Ethiel Cain's ablum called Preacher Daughter is not only a one of the most heart breaking songs but the most complex story I have ever listen to in song form. Being a writer and beloved reader I was practically born to love stories since the very beginning. Ethel Cain's ablum is quite the most in depth story about mystery, heartbreak, religion and some triggering topics. Their is a beauty to the way this girl writes. My favorite in the ablum is American Teenager. In this song it grabbles with what it was like for this character to live life as a teenger, growing, and seeing changing relationships with her family, love ones, and her religion. The depth this song has is just pure beauty so it had to be on my list for this summer. </p>
