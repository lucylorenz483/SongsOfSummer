            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p> Ethel Cain's album Preacher’s Daughter is not only one of the most heartbreaking collections of songs but also the most complex story I have ever listened to in song form. As a writer and avid reader, I was practically born to love stories from the very beginning, and Ethel Cain's album is one of the most in-depth narratives about mystery, heartbreak, religion, and some other triggering topics. There is a unique beauty in the way she writes. My favorite track on the album is American Teenager. In this song, it grapples with what it was like for the character to live life as a teenager, growing up and experiencing changing relationships with her family, loved ones, and her religion. The depth of this song is pure beauty, so it had to be on my list for this summer.</p>
