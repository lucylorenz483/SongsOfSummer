But becasuse tof there rap battle that they had going on we probaly got the one best moments in rap hisory and jaw dropping songs. One of those songs has to be Kendrick Lamar's single Not Like Us. With amazing ballads and verses he uses clear understanding words for the listener. This songs gold is the lryics that play throughout this song. Each and every word there with purpose and feeling, even who a bsic beat you can still feel the emotion in which Kendrick is rapping.  </p>
