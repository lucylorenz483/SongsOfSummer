            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>If you haven't heard about the Drake and Kendrick Lamar drama this summer, then you’ve probably been living under a rock. But because of their rap battle, we probably got one of the best moments in rap history and some jaw-dropping songs. One of those songs is Kendrick Lamar's single Not Like Us. With amazing ballads and verses, Kendrick uses clear, impactful words that resonate with the listener. The gold in this song is the lyrics, each word delivered with purpose and feeling. Even with a basic beat, you can still feel the deep emotion in Kendrick's rapping. </p>
