            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p> Suki Waterhouse is another British indie artist whose spunky music has caught quite a lot of people's attention in recent years. Earlier this summer, she released a single called "OMG." The song explores the experience of finding love and becoming completely consumed by it, reflecting on how falling in love can cause you to lose a part of who you were before. It's a relatable theme, and despite the somewhat sad undertones, Suki Waterhouse turns it into a zippy indie pop track that's perfect for singing along to in the shower.   </p>
