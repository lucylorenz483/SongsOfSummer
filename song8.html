            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p> Suki Waterhouse another british indie artist. Her spunky music has caught quite a lot of peoples attention in recent years. Earlier this summer she came out with a single called OMG. It is about finding love and being consumed by it. That when you fall in love you lose a part of who you were in the past before you were in love. It is a relatable song and as sad as the topic is Suki Waterhouse creates a zippy pop indie song that you could sing along to in the shower.    </p>
