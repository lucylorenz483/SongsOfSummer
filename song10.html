            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This summer of 2024 has been a Sabrina Carpenter summer. Her slow rise to fame has really made a big affect on the internet with her resent song getting on many high charts. If anyone was to rule this summer I would put her at the top. Being one of the newest artists to have a big break like that. But I have to say she has grown on me her other two singles that have come out before he new ablum were Expresso and Please, Please, Please. Both songs took a little to grow on me becuase pop like that isn't my most favorite. But when Sabrina Carpenters full ablum called Shot N' Sweet came out the first track on the list had my mouth wide open. The song is a sing-a-long song. A song to make you want to sit out the summer sun all day. This song came out lste this summer but I still think it is one of her best songs she has ever written.  </p>
