            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This summer of 2024 has truly been a Sabrina Carpenter summer. Her gradual rise to fame has made a significant impact on the internet, with her recent songs climbing many high charts. If anyone were to rule this summer, I would place her at the top, especially given her breakthrough as one of the newest artists to achieve such success. I must admit, she has really grown on me. Her previous singles, "Expresso" and "Please, Please, Please," took a little time to grow on me because pop isn't usually my favorite genre. However, when Sabrina Carpenter's full album, Shot N' Sweet, was released, the first track left me speechless. The song is an absolute sing-along anthem, perfect for enjoying a day under the summer sun. Although this track was released later in the summer, I still believe it’s one of the best songs she has ever written.  </p>
