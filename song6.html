            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Lana Del Ray the amazing writer she is worked with the rapper Quvao to creat one the best beats of the summer. Starting off slow the song opens with this sultery beat ampflied with Lana Del Rays. When Quavo comes in with his veruses you creates this chill upbeat song with Lana's beauty background vocals. </p>
