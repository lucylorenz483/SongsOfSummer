            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p> NIKI, a rising indie pop artist, continues to capture the hearts of many, and I’ve been a devoted fan of her and her music for as long as I can remember. Her ability to blend upbeat melodies with vivid storytelling has always resonated deeply with me. Every song she releases feels like a personal experience, drawing you into her world with each note and lyric.
                 This summer, NIKI released her new album titled Buzz, and it's everything a fan like me could hope for. The album is packed with tracks that exude the carefree, vibrant energy of the season, but the standout for me is the title track, "Buzz." This song is a perfect embodiment of summertime—filled with imagery of blooming fruits, the gentle hum of bees, and the sweet sensation of falling in love. It’s an anthem that captures the essence of warm days and endless possibilities.
                For me, "Buzz" isn’t just a song; it's a celebration of the season. It wraps you up in its sunny melodies and infectious rhythm, making it impossible not to smile. If there’s a track that screams summertime, it’s this one, and it has undoubtedly become one of my favorites this year.  </p>
